# AWS Red Team Simulation: S3 Bucket Policy Exfiltration via Stratus

This project demonstrates a controlled, automated red team exercise simulating a common data exfiltration technique in AWS. Using the open-source attack framework **Stratus Red Team**, I successfully backdoored an S3 bucket policy to grant unauthorized access and then safely reverted the environment to its original state.

The entire attack lifecycleâ€”from provisioning infrastructure with Terraform, to detonating the attack, and cleaning upâ€”was managed through Stratus, showcasing a modern, programmatic approach to testing and validating cloud security postures.

## Attack Methodology & Workflow

The simulation follows a structured methodology where an attacker, from an external host, uses Stratus Red Team to orchestrate the exploit. The framework abstracts the attack into a clean, multi-stage lifecycle.

1.  **Warmup:** Stratus uses Terraform to provision the necessary prerequisite infrastructure in the target AWS account (e.g., the target S3 bucket).
2.  **Detonate:** Stratus applies the malicious configurationâ€”in this case, attaching a backdoor policy to the S3 bucket that grants an external IAM principal `s3:*` access.
3.  **Verification:** The attacker uses the AWS CLI to verify that the malicious policy is active and that they have gained unauthorized access.
4.  **Revert & Cleanup:** Stratus safely reverts the malicious change and then uses Terraform to destroy all created infrastructure, leaving the environment in a clean, "cold" state.

## Execution: Detonation & Verification

The core of the simulation is the "detonation" phase. After `warming up` the technique, the `stratus detonate` command was executed. This action applies the malicious bucket policy.

**Analysis:** The screenshot below captures the successful detonation. I immediately ran `aws s3api get-bucket-policy` against the target bucket. The returned JSON policy is the proof of a successful exploit: it contains a statement granting `s3:*` permissions to an external `root` user, effectively backdooring the bucket. The Stratus status confirms the technique is `DETONATED`.

## Remediation: Revert & Cleanup

A critical part of any professional red team exercise is the ability to safely undo all actions. Stratus manages this through its `revert` and `cleanup` commands.

**Analysis:** The `stratus revert` command cleanly removes the malicious bucket policy. To validate this, I immediately ran `aws s3api get-bucket-policy` again. The command now returns a `NoSuchBucketPolicy` error, providing definitive proof that the backdoor was removed and the bucket is no longer exposed. The Stratus status returns to `WARM`, indicating the environment is safe. The final `stratus cleanup` command (not pictured) then destroys all infrastructure.
