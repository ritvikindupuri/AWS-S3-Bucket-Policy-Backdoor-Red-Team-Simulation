### Minimal IAM Scope (example)

Use a role restricted to this technique in a non-production account. Adjust ARNs to your environment and add logging/assume-role as needed.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetBucketPolicy",
        "s3:PutBucketPolicy",
        "s3:DeleteBucketPolicy"
      ],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::stratus-red-team-*"]
    }
  ]
}
